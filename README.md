# E2EE
## E2EE(end-to-end encryption) Model
This repository contains PNG files that illustrate the concept of End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).
## What is End-to-End Encryption?
End-to-End Encryption is a security measure that ensures that only the intended recipients of a message can access and read its contents. It prevents any intermediaries or eavesdroppers from intercepting or tampering with the communication.
